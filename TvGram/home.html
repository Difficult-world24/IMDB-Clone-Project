					Halter
					who
					is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his
					obsession
					with famous last words has only made him crave "the Great Perhaps" even more (Francois
					Rabelais,
					poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek
					Boarding
					School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young.
					The
					gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska
					Young.
					She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great
					Perhaps,
					and steals his heart. Then. . . After. Nothing is ever the same.</p>
